        <img class="first-img" src="images/webdesdev.png" alt="web des&dev-img">
        <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started my coding journey when I was 14 years old. HTML was all the rave, and I must have built over a hundred websites that first year alone. I have since also mastered CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience completing real world projects for freelance clients.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="second-img" src="images/python.png" alt="python-img">
        <h3>Python Programming language</h3>
        <p class="second_skill_desc">Python is my true passion. While studying Network Security, I was writing scripts in Python daily. I found myself enjoying the coding more than anything, and decided to make it my main focus. I have a firm foundation of the core language, as well as OOP concepts and patterns. I also have experience working with many popular python packages, such as <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and <strong>Tkinter</strong> (just to name a few).</p>

        <img class="third-img" src="images/learning.png" alt="learning-img">
        <h3>Knowledge and Experience</h3>
        <p class="third_skill_desc">Through my studies and course work I have experience building many real-world projects. From these projects I gained a firm understanding of many concepts and how to use them. Some of these include the web Python framework <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>web services and REST API</strong>, <strong>machine learning/data science</strong>, and databases like <strong>SQL</strong>. My most valuable skill though, is my ability to read documentation, problem solve, and learn new packages and concepts quickly.</p>
