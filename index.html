      <h2 class="hello">Hello</h2>      <p class="intro">I am a Python/JavaScript Programmer and Web Developer, who also loves 3D Animation. I have experience working in Linux, and Mac OS, with a good
 knowledge of BASH/ZSH. I spend most of my time learning and creating, with my most recent interest being game design.</p>

        <img class="first-img" src="images/webdesdev.png" alt="web des&dev-img">
        <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started my coding journey when I was 14 years old. HTML was all the rave, and I must have built over a hundred websites that first year alone. I have since also mastered CSS, JavaScript, and the many packages and Frameworks that go with web development (Node.js, Express, jQuery, React, etc). Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience completing real world projects for freelance clients.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="second_skill_desc">I have been coding for many years, and learned how to use many languages. Python is hands down my favorite language to work with. While studying Network Security, I was writing scripts in Python daily. I found myself enjoying the coding more than anything, and decided to make it my main focus. I have a firm foundation of the core language, as well as OOP concepts and patterns. I also have experience working with many popular python packages, such as <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and <strong>Tkinter</strong> (just to name a few).</p>

        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p class="third_skill_desc">In 2006 I attended Fullsail University for Game Design & Development. I learned the tools and concepts needed for animating 2D and 3D as well. I have most experience using Blender for all aspets of my workflow (although I sometimes animate using Unity which I am most familar as far as game development engines. I utilize the programming I know as well as knowledge of 3d design and animation to create in this space. Right now though, it is purely a hobby.</p>

        <h3>Knowledge and Experience</h3>
        <p class="fourth_skill_desc">Through my studies and course work, I have experience building many real-world projects. From these projects I gained a firm understanding of many concepts and how to use them. My most valuable skill though, is my ability to read documentation, problem solve, and learn new packages and concepts quickly.</p>
